# snake-game

I successfully developed a classic snake game using Python, leveraging the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for efficient and organized code. The game features a player-controlled snake that moves around the screen. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, and the objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the game or its own tail.

## Key Features:

Score Tracking: The game includes a score system that keeps track of the number of food items the snake consumes. The score increases with each food item eaten, providing a sense of achievement and challenge to the player.

High Score: Additionally, the game retains the highest score achieved throughout multiple playthroughs. This feature adds an element of competition and motivation for players to beat their personal bests.

Collision Detection: To enhance the gameplay experience, the game features sophisticated collision detection mechanisms. The snake is programmed to detect collisions with the game boundaries, its own tail, and the food items. When a collision occurs, the game ends, and the player has the option to start anew or exit.
